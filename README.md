# Diverse Machine Learning Approaches to MNIST Dataset

This repository was born out of the learnings and experiences from my graduate course, CS546 Machine Learning, in the Computer Science department at the University of Washington. This project is a machine learning techniques on the renowned MNIST dataset, which I've assembled as a personal knowledge base and practical toolkit. 

The MNIST dataset is a large collection of handwritten digits, widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning for image recognition. It consists of 70,000 grayscale images, each 28x28 pixels, divided into a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples, representing digits from 0 to 9.

The main file is an iPython notebook "MNIST.ipynb" that contains the following sections:

- Load up the data and visualize
- k-means clustering (manual implementation)
- OLS and Ridge Regression (manual implementation)
- Binary Regularized Logistic Regression
	- Gradient Descent (manual implementation)
	- Stochastic Gradient Descent (manual implementation)
- Multinomial Logit Regression (Pytorch)
- Neural Networks (Pytorch)
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
